Description: Functions for computing subscores for a test using different
    methods in both classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT). This
    package enables three sets of subscoring methods within the framework of CTT
    and IRT: Wainer's augmentation method, Haberman's three subscoring methods, and
    Yen's objective performance index (OPI). The package also includes the function
    to compute Proportional Reduction of Mean Squared Errors (PRMSEs) in Haberman's
    methods which are used to examine whether test subscores are of added value.
